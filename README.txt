For this project, you will implement a simple game with the following rules:
    • This game may have one or more players.

    • The object of the game is to guess a secret word from a bank of words

    • Players take turns

    • On each turn, the player gets to guess a possible letter that might be in the word.

    • After guessing a letter, the program tells the player how many occurrences of that letter are in the secret word.

    • The game should NOT tell the player the position of letters in the word.

    • Optionally on that same turn, the player can also try to guess the word.

    • The program tracks how many letter guesses and how many word guesses each player makes.

    • A player’s final score is the number of turns (letter guesses) they made before guessing the correct
    word. Lower scores are better.

    • Each player only has three word guesses, and they lose the game if they get their third guess wrong.


**Ideas for additional options and features of the Word Guessing Game**
    • How big is the bank of words? Could the bank of words have a theme or a hint of some kind?
    • Will the game tell the player how long the word is? Or are all words in the game a certain length?
      Or is word length completely unknown to the player?
    • Will the game display a list of all the letters guessed so far, or will it force the player to try to
      remember?
    • Can the game record the scores by writing results to a list?
    • Does the game “remember” and avoid any words it used before with a player (effectively changing the word bank each game)?
